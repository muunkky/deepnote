# step 3: project-open-list-api — `GET /api/project`

> **Sprint**: LUI1WEDGE | **Step**: 3 | **Roadmap**: m3/s1/serve-api/project-open-list-api
> **Depends on**: step 2 (server-package-scaffold, `87ifqe`). **Unblocks**: step 4A (execute-stream-ws), step 4B (save-api — needs `openHash`).

## API Feature Overview

* **Feature Description:** Open a `.deepnote` (or convertible) project and return its metadata + full notebook/block tree with persisted outputs — no kernel required (viewer-friendly).
* **API Resource/Endpoint:** `GET /api/project` → `ApiProject`.
* **HTTP Methods:** GET only (read-only).
* **API Version:** s1 app-level contract (unversioned wedge surface).
* **Related Work:** design doc Phase 2 + KD-6; ADR-007 §6; depends on scaffold `87ifqe`.
* **Client Impact:** the m3/s2 SPA viewer (consumes the full `ApiProject` envelope incl. `capabilities`); any future host.
* **Target Release:** m3/s1.

**Required Checks:**
- [x] **API resource/endpoint** path is clearly defined.
- [x] **API version** is specified and versioning strategy is understood.
- [x] **Client impact** is identified (who will consume this API).

| `docs/designs/m3-s1-server-api-and-serve.md` | "Phase 2: Open project + list API"; "Interface Design > HTTP surface" (`ApiProject`); KD-6 | The `ApiProject` shape, `loadProject()`/`startEngine()` split, `openHash`, `capabilities`. |
| `packages/cli/src/commands/run.ts` | `setupProject` (298–405); `resolveAndConvertToDeepnote` import (45) | The resolution sequence to reuse (interpreter/kernel resolution + convert), as `run.ts` composes it. |

## API Design & Contract Review

- [x] API design guidelines reviewed (REST conventions, naming, HTTP status codes).
- [x] Existing API contracts reviewed for consistency (similar endpoints, patterns).
- [x] OpenAPI/Swagger specification template reviewed for documentation format.
- [x] Authentication/authorization requirements reviewed (OAuth, API keys, JWT).
- [x] Rate limiting and quota policies reviewed for this endpoint.
- [x] Versioning strategy reviewed (URL versioning, header versioning, deprecation policy).

| Design Aspect | Decision / Requirement | Rationale / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resource Naming** | `GET /api/project` | Single opened project per serve process. |
| **HTTP Methods** | GET (read-only, no kernel) | KD-6: opening is pure deserialization + resolution metadata. |
| **Response Format** | `ApiProject { path, metadata, project, openHash, capabilities }` | Canonical envelope; SPA derives view-models from `project`. |
| **Status Codes** | 200 OK; 400 on bad/unresolvable path | KD-6: missing kernel does NOT fail open — surfaces on run. |
| **Authentication** | none (localhost-trust, NG4) | Bind localhost only. |
| **Versioning** | app-level contract, unversioned in s1 | The wedge surface; deliberate versioning is a later concern. |
| **Error Format** | `{ error }` JSON | Resolution failure on bad nb/path. |
| **Backward Compatibility** | additive only | `ApiProject` is the SPA contract. |

## API Development Phases

## Definition of Done

### Intent

Someone pointing the server at a `.deepnote` file can fetch the whole project — metadata and every notebook/block with its previously-saved outputs — and render it without a kernel ever starting, exactly as if they had deserialized the file directly. This is what lets the m3/s2 viewer paint a notebook before (or without) any execution. If this breaks, the viewer would show a project that differs from what `deepnote run`/the file actually contains (missing blocks, dropped persisted outputs), or it would refuse to open a project just because the kernel is mis-installed.

### Observable outcomes

- [x] **Capstone:** `GET /api/project` over a real fixture returns an `ApiProject` whose `project` + `metadata` deep-equal `deserializeDeepnoteFile(<same fixture bytes>)` (persisted outputs intact), and the request succeeds with **no kernel started**.
- [x] `openHash` is a stable SHA-256 of the on-disk bytes at open time (same bytes in → same hash).
- [x] `capabilities` reports `kernelLanguage` and `reactivity` derived from resolution, with a missing/mis-installed kernel reflected as a capability flag (not an open failure).
- [x] A bad/unresolvable project path returns `400 { error }`, not a crash.

## TDD Implementation Workflow

| Step | Status/Details | Universal Check |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **1. Write Contract Tests** | `ApiProject` shape matches `api-types.ts` | - [x] Contract tests validate API adheres to OpenAPI spec. |
| **2. Write Failing Integration Tests** | GET /api/project deep-equal vs direct deserialize; works with no kernel | - [x] Integration tests written covering all endpoints and methods. |
| **3. Implement API Endpoints** | `session.loadProject()` (split from `startEngine()`), HTTP router | - [x] API endpoints implemented, returning correct status codes. |
| **4. Run Passing Tests** | green | - [x] All integration tests pass, API behavior verified. |
| **5. Add Error Handling Tests** | bad path → 400 (mocked) | - [x] Error handling tests written and passing. |
| **6. Security Tests** | no kernel port returned in payload | - [x] Security tests validate auth, input sanitization, rate limiting. |
| **7. Performance Tests** | N/A | - [x] Performance validated against requirements [if applicable]. |
| **8. Regression Suite** | package test green | - [x] Full regression suite passed, no existing APIs broken. |

#### API Implementation Notes

> **Test Strategy (behavior + failure modes):** the capstone is a deep-equal against `deserializeDeepnoteFile` on real fixture bytes — unfakeable by a mock since the payload must reproduce the real tree incl. persisted outputs. Failure-mode tests: (a) no kernel started yet a full tree returns (KD-6 viewer-friendliness); (b) `openHash` stability; (c) bad path → 400. The `loadProject`/`startEngine` split is what makes (a) testable — keep load pure of kernel side effects.

**Middleware Stack:** none (localhost, no auth).

**Database Queries:** N/A — filesystem deserialize.

**Caching Strategy:** the opened project + `openHash` are held in the `session`; not re-read per request.

## API Validation & Release

| Task | Detail/Link |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OpenAPI Spec Location** | `api-types.ts` `ApiProject` (typed contract, not a YAML spec) |
| **API Documentation URL** | package README `GET /api/project` |
| **Integration Test Coverage** | deep-equal vs deserialize on a fixture + bad-path 400 |
| **Security Validation** | localhost bind; kernel port never in payload |
| **Performance Metrics** | N/A |
| **Client Communication** | SPA consumes `ApiProject` from `/types` |

## Executor Close-out (LUI1WEDGE / x71bcm, cycle 1)

**Status:** implementation complete, tests green. Left in `in_progress` for the reviewer
(the two "API contract reviewed and approved by team/stakeholders" boxes are the reviewer's
gate — intentionally left unchecked).

**Commit:** `e88fd33` on `worktree-agent-a4a53574491e3cf59` (merges back to `milestone/m3-local-ui`
per the batch directive's branch override). Completion tag: `LUI1WEDGE-x71bcm-done`.

### What shipped

- `packages/runtime-server/src/session.ts` — `Session` with the KD-6 `loadProject()` /
  `startEngine()` split. `loadProject` reads the on-disk bytes, computes a hex SHA-256
  `openHash` over the raw bytes, deserializes via `deserializeDeepnoteFile`, and resolves
  the capability flags — **with no kernel started**. `startEngine()` is forward-declared
  for Phase 3 (not built here). The loaded project + `openHash` are held in the session
  (the design-doc caching strategy; not re-read per request).
- `packages/runtime-server/src/router.ts` — a framework-free `node:http` router (`createRouter`)
  serving `GET /api/project` from the opened `Session`. Unknown routes / non-GET methods on
  `/api/project` → `404 { error }`; a bad/unloaded project → `400 { error }`.
- `packages/runtime-server/src/server.ts` — `createServer` now accepts an opened `session`
  and routes through `createRouter`; the no-session scaffold path still 503s (keeping the
  step-2 lifecycle test valid).
- `packages/runtime-server/src/index.ts` — exports `Session`, `LoadProjectOptions`, `createRouter`.
- `packages/runtime-server/README.md` — a full `GET /api/project` section (usage, `200`
  `ApiProject` body, the `400`/`404` error table, the KD-6 no-kernel guarantee).
- `packages/runtime-server/test/fixtures/open-project.deepnote` — a self-contained fixture
  with a **persisted code output**, so the deep-equal capstone proves persisted outputs survive.

### Capabilities resolution (KD-6, kernel-free) — design decision worth flagging for review

- `kernelLanguage`: `selectKernelName` (ADR-003) + an interpreter *probe* via
  `resolvePythonExecutable(selectPythonSpec(...))` (ADR-001) that is **never executed** —
  it only checks the path resolves. Python + resolvable interpreter → `'python'`; explicit
  non-python kernel → the kernel name; **mis-installed interpreter → `null`** (the "kernel
  missing" flag — the open still succeeds and returns the full tree).
- `reactivity`: **always `'disabled'` in s1.** Reactive execution is an m3/s5 deliverable
  (design-doc B3 / Open Questions). Emitting `'python'` now would advertise a capability that
  does not exist; `'python'` activates only when m3/s5 wires reactive execution. This matches
  the contract sample in `api-types.test.ts` (`reactivity: 'disabled'`).

### Tests (TDD; written before implementation)

`src/session.test.ts` (10) + `src/router.test.ts` (5), all green; full package suite **22/22**.

- **Capstone (session + HTTP):** `apiProject().{metadata,project}` and the over-the-wire
  `GET /api/project` body both deep-equal `deserializeDeepnoteFile(<same fixture bytes>)`,
  **persisted stream output intact**, with no kernel started. This is unfakeable by a mock —
  the payload must reproduce the real deserialized tree.
- `openHash` stability (hex SHA-256 of on-disk bytes; same bytes in → same hash, asserted
  against an independent `createHash` over the fixture).
- Capability flags: python3 default → `{kernelLanguage:'python', reactivity:'disabled'}`;
  mis-installed interpreter → `{kernelLanguage:null, reactivity:'disabled'}` with the tree
  still returned (KD-6 — not an open failure); non-python kernel → its name + `disabled`.
- Bad path → reject (→ 400 at the HTTP boundary); malformed `.deepnote` → reject; unloaded
  session → `apiProject()` throws → `400`; unknown route / POST → `404`.

**Honest scope note:** the capstone runs against the in-package fixture
`test/fixtures/open-project.deepnote` (a real `.deepnote` with a persisted output), NOT against
a production project. The deep-equal-vs-`deserializeDeepnoteFile` invariant is exact for that
fixture; broader real-file coverage rides with the serve-command wiring (step 5).

### ADR-007 boundary respected

The server does **not** import `@deepnote/cli` (the one-way arrow is `cli → runtime-server`).
The CLI's `resolveAndConvertToDeepnote` (format conversion) was deliberately **not** reused —
it lives in the CLI and would invert the arrow. s1 open is `.deepnote` deserialization +
runtime-core resolution primitives only; arbitrary-format conversion at the server boundary is
out of scope for this contract.

### Quality gates (the b1 push-blocker the directive flagged)

Run on the worktree, all clean:
- `biome check --write packages/runtime-server` — fixed an import-order issue in `index.ts`
  (the exact b1 class), re-verified clean (14 files, no remaining fixes).
- `prettier --write packages/runtime-server/README.md` — reformatted, re-verified.
- `pnpm spell-check` / cspell — added `unfakeable` to `docs-dictionary.txt` (not source);
  re-verified clean. (Note: running cspell from inside `.claude/worktrees/...` reports
  "0 files" because the worktree path is under cspell's ignored `.claude/**`; verified by
  pointing cspell at the explicit changed files with `--no-gitignore`.)
- `tsc --noEmit` (package + root `-p tsconfig.json`) — clean.
- `check:types-subpath` (capstone consumer vs built `dist/`) — clean.
- Vitest 22/22 (run with the documented `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS=2 VITEST_TEST_TIMEOUT=30000`
  env tuning — the default 5s timeout misses the cold-module-graph python-subprocess probe,
  exactly as the root `vitest.config.ts` comment describes; not a logic issue).

### One pre-existing scaffold fix (flag for reviewer)

`tsconfig.json` (root) now excludes `**/*.capstone.ts`. The step-2 `types-consumer.capstone.ts`
is designed to be typechecked **only** by `check:types-subpath` against the built `dist/` (it
imports the `@deepnote/runtime-server/types` subpath, unresolvable under the root `paths` alias).
The general typecheck (`tsc -p tsconfig.json` and `pnpm -r exec tsc`) was already globbing it and
failing with `TS2307` **before** my changes — a latent scaffold gap, not introduced here. Excluding
the capstone glob is the documented intent (the file's own header) and the minimal, no-tech-debt
fix; it touches that one fixture only.

### Deferred / N/A (s1 unpublished, localhost-trust, in-process API)

No deferral cards were needed. The N/A Completion-Checklist items (OpenAPI YAML spec, auth/rate
limiting, perf reqs, client SDKs, prod deploy, monitoring/alerts, client comms) do not apply to an
unpublished local-process API bound to localhost (NG4). The **API changelog** is owned by the sprint
closeout card per this card's own "API Changelog Updated? → Closeout card handles CHANGELOG." The two
**stakeholder-approval** boxes are left unchecked as the reviewer's gate.
